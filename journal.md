Date: 8.27.2025 - Subject: Git Repo. Today I learned how to use git and creating git repository locally and remotelly. Notes:
 1. To initialize a git repositoty in that directory type:
    git init.
 2. to check the status of the repo:
    git status
 3. To tell git to track our newly file:
    git add filename.py 
 4. take a snapstop of the program:
    git commit -m "message"
 5. to see the lists of commits:
    git log 
 6. to make an empty journal file:
    touch filename.md
